# Learning to play Othello (without human knowledge)

But for now, it's with human knowledge ;-)

We're learning to predict the outcome of a game. And we're learning from dataset of human games.

To run, do:
```sh
./INSTALL
. RUN
```

The `./INSTALL` command will create a local folder called `.conda_environment`. This folder will contain all Python packages used within this project - it's like a local environment for the project's executables.

Enjoy!
